Augmented Reality (AR)  is a human-computer interaction technology towards natural interaction and invisible computer interface. By superimposing digital objects in the physical environments, AR can enhance people's perception of the dynamic real world by presenting information that is hard for human senses to perceive and give in-situ action guidance. Thus, various AR applications are designed to assist users in completing urgent tasks in complex circumstances. The user interface is one of the key components of these applications, while its design has had few breakthroughs in the past two decades. These applications have more and more end users nowadays, so it is time to consider their user interface design to provide a better user experience. However, existing works lack an overview of current design practices in existing AR applications, such as the user needs and design considerations. To fill this gap,  we first identify four types of user needs and classify existing applications based on these needs. Then we conduct an in-depth analysis of the user interface design, identify six common design dimensions, and summarize current practices. We conclude with a discussion about limitations and future directions for improving user interface design for AR applications that facilitate real-time tasks.
