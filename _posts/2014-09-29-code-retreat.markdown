This summer, I was at Google in NYC for an awesome internship. However, in this post I want to talk about a [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/) that somebody at Google organized. The idea is simple: Pair up a bunch of programmers and give them a simple programming task that they can solve as a pair in any language but with a time constraint. Repeat this for a whole day for maximum fun. Each iteration may add [additional constraints](http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog) on how the team should work together or what programming constructs they are allowed to use. It's a great opportunity to learn from each other and from the experience of solving the same problem over and over again and bringing your program to perfection.

We used [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) throughout the day and I've grown to like it a lot. I just wanted to share my simple [implementation in Python](https://github.com/domoritz/gameoflife-python) and my [first program in Go](https://github.com/domoritz/gameoflife-go).

**Update:** I have since implement the Game of Live in Rust and C# and might add more in the future. The [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/domoritz?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=gameoflife).
